# Pixel 
**Pixel** is a Discord bot written in Python and contains a bunch of random commands. From greetings to sending cat images to asking trivia questions, and more, pixel is a fun-to-use chatbot!

NOTE: All code is in the ``MainCode.py`` file. Other files exist just to have chunks of code from the main file divided into categories, and to keep the code in other places to be able to make changes easily if/when needed when coding.

Please use the command `p;help` in Discord to learn more about the various commands the bot has as well as how to use it.
