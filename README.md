# Pixel 
*Pixel* is a Discord bot written in Python and contains a bunch of random commands. From greetings to sending cat images to asking trivia questions, and more, pixel is a fun-to-use chatbot!

All code is in the ``MainCode.py`` folder. Other folders are just to have chunks of code from the main file in other folders.
